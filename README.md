# ECG_Prototype
This notebook use neurokit and heartpy packages to filter ECG waves and extract the main features from these waves.

* Dataset: we used ecg-id-database from Physionet to test our algorithms.

# Technologies
1- neurokit: used to exctract main features to distinguish between people.

2- heartpy: used to filter ECG waves and remove the noise.

## Future work
we are looking for using the smartwatches to take the ECG waves and send them to these algorithms to build an authentication system.
